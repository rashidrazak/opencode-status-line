# Releasing

Publishing is automated in [`.github/workflows/publish.yml`](.github/workflows/publish.yml):
pushing the `v*` tag that `npm version` creates publishes the tagged version to
npm and creates the GitHub Release from the version's `CHANGELOG.md` section,
in one run. Authentication is npm **trusted publishing** (OIDC) — no `NPM_TOKEN`
secret exists, and npm attaches a provenance attestation automatically.

Tags are cut only when a maintainer decides to release: merging a pull request
never tags anything, and no workflow creates a tag. The pipeline only refuses a
tag whose commit is not on `main`, so a tag cut on a branch cannot publish.

## One-time npm setup

npm only offers its trusted-publisher settings page once the package exists, so
the first version is published by hand (this is how `1.0.0` is bootstrapped).
The package is scoped as `@rashidrazak/opencode-status-line`: npm's registry
rejects the unscoped name as too similar to the existing `opencode-statusline`.
That is the only time publishing happens outside CI, and every step of the
workflow skips what already exists, so the bootstrap tag or Release is safe to
create afterwards. The npm account needs two-factor authentication enabled —
npm requires it to configure trusted publishers.

1. **Claim the package name** (once, for the bootstrap release) from a checkout
   of `main`:

   ```sh
   npm login
   npm publish
   ```

   `prepublishOnly` builds the npm entry, then runs the suite and `check-pack`,
   so a broken tree — or an unbuilt one — cannot ship.

2. **Trust this repository** on npmjs.com: *package → Settings → Trusted
   Publisher → Add trusted publisher → GitHub Actions*:

   | Field                | Value                                          |
   | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
   | Organization or user | `rashidrazak`                                  |
   | Repository           | `opencode-status-line`                         |
   | Workflow filename    | `publish.yml`                                  |
   | Environment name     | *(leave empty — the workflow uses no environment)* |
   | Allowed actions      | enable **npm publish** (direct publishing)     |

   The values are case-sensitive and are checked when the workflow publishes,
   not when you save. `npm stage publish` is always allowed; direct
   `npm publish` is opt-in, and this workflow uses the direct path.

3. **Recommended**: *Settings → Publishing access → Require two-factor
   authentication and disallow tokens*. Trusted publishers keep working while
   long-lived tokens stop being able to publish; delete any token you no longer
   need.

For the bootstrap version, push its tag once npm has it — the workflow finds
the version already published and only creates the Release:

```sh
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
```

A hand-published version carries no provenance attestation; every version
published by CI does.

## Cutting a release

From a clean `main`:

```sh
git switch main && git pull

# Move the `## [Unreleased]` entries under a new `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
# heading (keeping an empty Unreleased) and commit that first.
$EDITOR CHANGELOG.md
git commit -am "docs: release X.Y.Z"

npm version minor                  # or patch / major; commits package.json and tags vX.Y.Z
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

That is the whole release. Pushing the tag triggers `publish.yml`, which:

1. checks that the tagged commit is on `main` — a tag cut on a branch cannot
   publish — and that it matches `package.json`;
2. verifies `CHANGELOG.md` has a non-empty section for the version — its body
   becomes the Release notes;
3. runs the test suite;
4. publishes with `--tag latest` — or `--tag next` when the version has a
   pre-release suffix — and skips with a notice if that version is already on
   the registry;
5. creates the GitHub Release from the changelog section, marked as a
   pre-release for a pre-release version, unless the Release already exists;
6. lets npm attach provenance, visible on the package page.

Creating the Release by hand (`gh release create …` or the web UI) runs the same
workflow; every step skips what already exists, so the tag and the Release can
never publish the same version twice.

`CHANGELOG.md` is the single source of release notes: the workflow fails before
anything is published when the tagged version has no section, so the registry
never gets ahead of the file. Verify what is live after a release:

```sh
npm view @rashidrazak/opencode-status-line version dist-tags
gh release view "v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")"
```

## If publishing fails

- **`ENEEDAUTH` / 401**: the trusted-publisher fields must match exactly —
  user, repository, workflow filename (`publish.yml`, including extension),
  and the environment (empty). Re-check on npmjs.com; a saved configuration is
  not validated until a publish uses it.
- **Wrong version**: the tag and `package.json` disagree; the check runs before
  anything is uploaded.
- **Tag not on `main`**: the tagged commit is not part of `main`'s history —
  the tag was cut on a branch, a PR head or a local commit. Land the release on
  `main`, delete the stray tag, and re-tag the merge commit.
- **Missing changelog section**: `node scripts/changelog-section.mjs <version>`
  prints the body or names what is missing. The release fails before npm is
  touched, so the registry stays clean.
- **Version already exists**: the workflow treats this as success and skips.
  Bump the version for new contents.
- **Re-run**: Actions → Publish → the failed run → *Re-run jobs* is safe; every
  step checks the registry and the Release instead of assuming.
